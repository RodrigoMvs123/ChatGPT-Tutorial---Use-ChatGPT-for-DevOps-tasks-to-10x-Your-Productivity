Task 1:
Dockerize Node.js App

JavaScript Application 
Node.js framework 
Code ( Ready ) / Dockerize ) 
Create a Dockerfile for Node.js app
ChatGPT 
Question: write a dockerfile for node.js application.
R: Here is a basic Dockerfile for a node.js application.

FROM node:12 
WORKDIR / app
COPY package.json /app
RUN npm install 
COPY . /app 
EXPOSE 3000
CMD [“npm”, “start”]

This dockerfile does the following:

Uses the official Node.js 12 image as the base image.
Sets the working directory to ‘/app’.
Copies the ‘package.json’ file to the working directory.
Install the dependencies listed in ‘package.json’ using ‘npm install’.
Copies the rest of the application code to the working directory.
Exposes port 3000
Specifies the command to ran when the container starts:’npm start

This Dockerfile assumes that your application has a ‘package.json’ file and that the main script to start the application is ‘npm start’.

To build the Docker image, run the following command in the same directory as Dockerfile: 
docker build -t my-node-app

This will build a Docker image with the name ‘my-node-app’
To run the Docker container, use the following command: 
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app

This will start the Node.js application in a Docker container and map port 3000 on the host to port 3000 in the container. You should the be able to access the application at http://localhost:3000


Question: Explain exactly what WORKDIR directive means in dockerfile ?  
The ‘WORKDIR’ directive in a Dockerfile specifies the working directory for the commands that follow it in the Dockerfile. The working directory is the directory in the filesystem of the container where the commands are run.

For example, in the following Dockerfile: 

FROM node:12
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm install 
COPY . /app 

The ‘WORKDIR’ directive sets the working directory to ‘/app’ , and the  ‘npm install’ command and ‘COPY’ directive will be run in that directory.
The ‘WORKDIR’ directive is similar to the ‘cd’ command in a shell script. It allows you to specify the directory where you want to run the commands in the Dockerfile, without 
have to manually ‘cd’ in the directory first.
You can specify an absolute path, it will be interpreted as relative to the current working directory. If you specify an absolute path, it will be interpreted as an absolute path in the container´s filesystem.

Question: use yarn instead of npm in dockerfile ? 
To use yarn instead of npm in a Dockerfile, you can replace the ‘RUN npm install’ command with ‘RUN yarn install’.

Here is an example Dockerfile that uses yarn: 

FROM node:12
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json /app
RUN yarn install 
COPY . /app
EXPOSE 3000
CMD [“yarn”, “start”]

This Dockerfile does the following:
Uses the official Node.js 12 images as the base image.
Sets the working directory to ‘/app’.
Copies the ‘package.json’ file to the working directory.
Installs the dependencies listed in ‘package.json’ using ‘yarn install’.
Copies the rest of the application code to the working directory.
Exposes port 3000.
Specifies the command to run when the container starts: ‘yarn start’

This Dockerfile assumes that your application has a ‘package.json’ file and that the main script to start the application is ‘yarn start’.
To build the Docker image, run the following command in the same directory as the Dockerfile:
docker build -t my-node-app
This will build a Docker image with the name ‘my-node-app’.
To run the Docker container , use the following command:
docker build -t my-node-app .
To run Docker container, use the following command:
docker run -p 3000:3000 my node app

This will start the Node.js application in a Docker container and map port 3000 on the host to port 3000 in the container. You should then be able to access the application at https://localhost:3000.




FROM node:12
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json /app
RUN yarn install 
                                                  COPY . /app
EXPOSE 3000
CMD [“yarn”, “start”]

.gitignore
node_modules
tests
app files

Question: Now only copy relevant application files, not everything to the app image
To only copy the relevant application files and not everything to the Docker image, you can use the ‘.dockerignore’ file. 

A ‘.dockerignore’ file is similar to a “.gitignore” file specifies patterns of file and directories that should be ignored when building the Docker image.

For example, If you want to ignore the ‘node_modules’ directory and all files in the ‘test’ directory, you can create a ‘.dockerignore’ file with the following contents:
node_module
test/
Then, in your Dockerfile, you can use the ‘COPY’ directive with the ‘- - exclude-from’ flag 
to exclude the files and directory specified in the ‘. dockerignore file: 

FROM node:12
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json / app 
RUN npm install 
COPY . /app ’   // - - exclude-from.dockerignore
EXPOSE 3000
CMD [“npm”, “start”] 

This Docker file does the following: 
1.  Uses the official Node.js image as the base image.
2.  Sets the working directory to ‘/app’.
3.   Copies the 'package.json' to the working directory. 
4.   Install the dependencies listed in ‘package.json’ using ‘npm install’.
5    Copies the rest of the application code to the working directory, excluding the files and directories specified in the ‘dockerignore’ file.
6   EXPOSE port 3000.
7   Specifies the command to run when the container start: ‘npm start’.

To build the Docker image, run the following command in the same directory as the Dockerfile: 
docker build -t my-node-app.
This will build a Docker image with the name ‘my-node-app’

To run the docker container, use the following command:
docker run -p 3000:3000 my node app 
This will start the Node.js application in a Docker container and map port 3000 on the host to port 3000 in the container. You should then be able to access the application at https://localhost:3000
  

Use a Multi-stage builds 
Question: use multi-stage build

To use a multi-stage build in a Dockerfile, you can use multiple ‘FROM’ statements in the same dockerfile. Each ‘FROM’ statement starts a new stage in the build process, and you can copy files from previous stages to the current stage using the ‘COPY - - from’ directive 

For example, consider the following Dockerfile: 
FROM node:12 as builder 
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json /app
RUN npm install
COPY . /app
RUN npm run build 
FROM nginx: 1.19 
COPY // - - from-builder /app/build/usr/share/nginx/html 

EXPOSE 80 
CMD [“nginx”, “-g”, “daemon off;”]    

This Dockerfile does the following:
Uses the official Node.js 12 images as the base image for the first stage and named it “builder”
Sets the working directory to ‘/app’ and copies the ‘package.json’ file to the working directory. ’. 
Installs the dependencies listed in ‘package.json’ using ‘npm install’.
Copies the rest of the application code to the working directory.
Runs the ‘npm run build’ command to build the application 
Uses the official nginx image as the base image for the second stage. 
Copies the build application from the ‘builder’ staged to ‘usr/share/nginx/html’ directory in the nginx image.
Exposes port 80.
Specifies the command to run when the container starts: ‘nginx -g “daemon off;”’

This Dockerfile demonstrates a common pattern for building a Node.js application in a Docker container: using a separated stage for building a Node.js application in a Docker container: using a separated stage for building the application and another stage for running the application. 

To build the Docker image, run the following command in the same directory as the Dockerfile: 
docker build -t my-node-app .
This will build a Docker image with the name ‘my-node-app’.
To run the Docker container , using the following command:
docker run -p 80:80 my-node-app

This will start the nginx server in a Docker container and serve the build Node.js
application, and map port 80 on the host to port 80 in the container. You should then be able to access the application at https://localhostal.

Question: adjust the multi-stage build to use yarn, exclude app files from dockerignore file when copying them into docker image and provider docker command examples with a specific image tag of 1.0

To adjust the multi-stage build to use yarn, you can replace the ‘RUN npm install’ and ‘RUN npm run build’ respectively.
To exclude certain files and directions from the ‘.dockerignore’ file when copying them in to the Docker image, you can use ‘!’ character in front of the pattern.
For example, If you want to ignore the ‘node_module’ directory but include de ‘build’ directory, you can create a ‘dockerignore’ file with the following contents: 
node_modules !build/
Here is an example Dockerfile that uses yarn, exclude certain files and directories from the ‘.dockerignore’ file, and tags the image with ‘1.0’: 

FROM node: 12 as builder 
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json /app
RUN yarn install
COPY . app - - exclude-from.dockerignore
RUN yarn build
FROM nginx:1.19 
COPY - - from-builder /app/build/usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80 
CMD [“nginx”, “-g”, “daemon off;”]
LABEL version- “1.0”

To build the Docker image with the ‘1.0’ tag, run the following command in the same directory as the Dockerfile: 
docker build -t my-node-app:1.0 .
To run the Docker container with the 1.0 tag, use the following command:
docker run -p 80:80 my-node-app:1.0

This will start the nginx server in a Docker container and serve the built Node.js application , and map port 80 on the host to port 80 in the container. You should then be able to access the application at https://localhost.

DevOps Task 2:
Create k8s ( Kubernetes )  Manifest 
Let´s stay in the same chat to have some context 
Create k8s manifest file for the same app

Question: create a k8s deployment manifest file for a docker image 
To create a Kubernetes deployment manifest file for a Docker image, you can use the ‘kubectl create deployment’ command. 
Here is an example deployment manifest file for a Docker image named ‘my-node-app’: 

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment 
Metadata:
   name:my-node-app
   labels:
   app: my-node-app
spec:
   replicas: 3 
   selector: 
    matchlabels: 
        app: my-node-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
       app:my-node-app
 spec: 
       containers:
name: my-node-app
             image: my-node-app:1.0
            ports:
containerPort: 80

This deployment manifest file does the following:
Create a development named ‘my-node-app’ .
Specifies that the deployment should have 3 replicas.
Specifies a label selector that matches pods with the label ‘app: my-node-app’ 
Defines a pod template that includes a container named ‘my-node-app’ using the ‘my-node-app:1.0’ Docker image and exposes port 80.

To create the deployment, run the following command: 
kubectl create -f deployment.yaml 
This will create the deployment and start 3 replicas of the ‘my-node-app’ pod.
To access the application you will need to create a service manifest file and using the ‘kubectl create service’ command.
Here is an example service manifest file for the ‘my-node-app’ deployment:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata: 
   name: my-node-app
spec:
   type: LoadBalancer 
   selector: 
    app: my-node-app
 ports:
protocol: TCP
          targetPort: 80 

This service manifest file does the following:
Create a service named ‘my-node-app’. 
Specifies that the service should be on type ‘LoadBalancer’
Specifies a label selector that matches pods with the label ‘app: my-node-app’.
Maps port 80 on the service to port 80 on the pods.
To create the service, run the following command:
kubectl create -f service yaml 
This creates the service and assigns it an external IP address. You can use the ‘kubectl get service’ command to find the external IP address of the service and access the application using that IP address.
kubectl get service my-node-app
This will output the details of the ‘my-node-app’ service, including the external IP address. You should be able to access the application at https://<EXTERNAL_IP>.

Question: add resources quotas to the deployment 

To add resources quotas to a deployment in Kubernetes, you can use the ‘resources’ field 
in the pod template of the deployment manifest file.
Here is an example of a deployment manifest file with resources quota for CPU and memory: 

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment 
metadata: 
  name: my-node-app
  labels:
  app: my-node-app
spec: 
   replicas: 3
selector 
MatchLabels: 
     app: my-node-app
       template:
         metadata:
           labels:
           app: my-node-app
spec:
          containers: 
          name: my-node-app
           image: my-node-app:1.0
         resources:
         limits:
        cpu: “500m”
        memory: “1G;” 
         request: 
         cpu: “100m”
       memory: “256Mi”
ports: - containerPort: 80


This deployment manifest file does the following 
1. Creates a Deployment named ‘my-node-app’.
2. Specifies that the deployment should have 3 replicas.
3. Specifies a label selector that matches pods with the label ‘app: my-node-app’. 
4  Defines a pod template that includes a container named ‘my-node-app’ using the 
‘my-node-app: 1.0’ Docker image and exposes the port 80.
 Sets resources limits for the container’s CPU and memory usage. The limits are set to 500milicores and 1GiB, respectively.
Sets resource requests for the container´s CPU and memory usage. The requests are set to 100 milicores and 256Mi, respectively. 

The resource limits and requests specify the maximum and minimum amount of resources that the container is allowed to use, respectively. The resource limits are used to prevent a single container from using too many resources and causing issues on the host. The resource request are used by the kubernetes scheduler to find the best nood to schedule the pod on. To create the deployment, run the following command: 
kubectl create -f deployment.yaml 
This will create the deployment and start 3 replicas of the ‘my-node-app’ pod with the specified resources quota. You can use the ‘kubectl describe pod’ command to view the resource quotas for a specific pod: 
kubectl describe pod <POD_NAME>
This will output the details of the pod, including the resources quotas.   

 
Adjust manifest file with production and security best practices..

Question: Adjust deployment manifest with production and security best practices.
 
There are a number of production and security best practices that you can follow when creating a deployment manifest file in Kubernetes. Here are some suggestions for adjusting the deployment manifest file:  

Use resources limits and requests: As mentioned in the previous answer, setting resource limits and requests for the container in the pod can help prevent resource contention and ensure that the pods are scheduled onto the best nodes.
Use liveness and readiness probes: You can use liveness probes to detect when a container is not working correctly and needs to be restarted, and readiness probes to detect when a container is not read to receive traffic. This can help ensure that the pods are running correctly and are only receiving traffic when they are ready.
Use secrets and ConfigMaps: Instead of storing sensitive data, such as passwords and tokens, in the deployment manifest file, you can use secrets and ConfigMaps to store and manage this data. This can help protect sensitive data and make it easier to manage.
Use roles and role bindings: To control access to resources in the cluster, you can use roles and role bindings to grant permissions to users and service accounts. This can help ensure that only authorized users and services have access to the resources they need. 

Here is an example of a deployment manifest file that incorporates these best practices:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment 
metadata:
    name: my-node-app
      labels:
        app: my-node-app
spec: 
       replicas: 3
         selector:
         MatchLabels:
         app: my-node-app
         template:
          metadata: 
            labels: 
             app: my-node-app
         spec: 
         containers:
       -  name: my-node-app
           image: my-node-app:1.0
          resources: 
           limits:
             cpu: “500m”
            memory: “1Gi” 
           requests: 
          cpu: “100m”
           memory: “256Mi”
        
 Question: it seems like some best practices are missing. So please adjust deployment file properly with production and security best practices, without explanations, just provide the example manifest file:

Here is an example of a deployment manifest file that incorporates production and security best practices:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata
   name: my-node-app
   labels: 
   app: my-node-app
spec:
   replicas: 3 
   selector:
   matchLabels: 
      app: my-node-app
   template: 
      metadata: 
         labels:    
         app: my-node-app 
spec:
       containers: 
name: my-node-app
image: my-node-app:1.0
 resources: 
limits: 
cpu: “500m”
memory: “1Gi”
          requests: 
              cpu: “100m”
             memory: “256Mi
             livenessProbe:
             httpGet:  
path: /healthz
              port: 80 
               initialDelaySeconds: 30
              periodSecond: 10 
               readinessProbe:
                httpGet: 
                   path: / ready
                      port: 80
                      initialDeploySeconds: 30
                     periodSeconds: 10
                    ports:
containerPort: 80 
          imagePullSecrets: 
name: my-registry-secret
   volumes: 
name: secrets 
                   secrets:
                       secretName: my-app-secrets 
name: config
                          configMap: 
                          name: my-app-config 
               serviceAccountName: my-app-service-account 


This deployment manifest file does the following:
Create a deployment named ‘my-node-app’. 
Specifies that the deployments should have 3 replicas.
Specifies a label selector that matches pods with the label ‘app: my-node-app’
Defines a pod template that includes a container named ‘my-node-app’ using the ‘my-node-app:1.0’ Docker image and exposes port 80.
Sets resources limits and requests for the container´s CPU and memory usage.
Configures liveness and readiness probes for the containers. 
Uses an image pull secret to authenticate with a container registry.
Mounts secrets and ConfigMaps as volumes in the container.
Specifies a service account for the pod to use.             
                  

‘
Question: on top of those new configuration options, also add securityContext configuration in the deployment file. 

To add a security context to a container in a deployment manifest file in Kubernetes, you can use the ‘securityContext ‘ field in the container spec.
Here is an example of a deployment manifest file incorporates a security context: 

apiVersion: app/v1
kind: Deployment 
metadata: 
   name: my-node-app
   labels:
   app: my-node-app
spec:
   replicas: 3
    selector: 
     matchLabels:
      app: my-node-app
     template:
    metadata:
   labels:
    app: my-node-app
spec:
   containers: 
name: my-node-app
            image: my-node-app:1.0 
          resources:
name: my-node-app
image: my-node-app:1.0
resources: 
          limits:
         cpu: “500m”
          memory: “1Gi”
        requests: 
         cpu: “100”
          memory: “256Mi”
              livenessProbe:
            httpGet: 
              path: healthz 
                 port: 80
                   initialDeleySeconds: 30 
                periodsSeconds: 10
              readinessProbe: 
                httpGet
              path: /ready
              port:80 
                initialDelaySeconds: 30 
                 periodsSeconds: 10
            ports:
containerPort: 80
securityContext:
                      runAsUser: 1000
                        runAsGroup: 3000
                     runAsNonRoot: true 
                   capabilities:
                  add:
NET_BIND_SERVICE 
imagePullSecrets: 
name: my-registry-secret
volumes:
name: secrets 
secrets:
secretName: my-app-secret
name:config 
configMap: 
name: my-app-config 
   serviceAccountName: my-app-service-account

This deployment manifest file does the following:

Create a deployment named ‘my-node-app’ .
Specifies that the deployment should have 3 replicas.
Specified a label selector that matches pods with the label ‘app: my-node-app’.
Defines a pod template that includes a container named ‘my-node-app’ using the ‘my-node-app:1’

        sh ‘kubectl - - kubeconfig $KUBE_CONFIG set image deployment/my-node-app my-node-app-my-node-app: $BUILD_NUMBER’
              }
            }
         }
      }          
   }   
       
Build Application 
Run Tests 
Build Docker Image 
Push Docker Image
Deploy to K8s


This Jenkinsfile does the following:
Define a pipeline with four stages: ‘Build’, ‘Test’,’Build Docker Image’, and ‘Push Docker Image’ 
In the ‘Build’ stage, runs ‘yarn install’ and ‘yarn build’ to build the Node.js application.
In the ‘Test’ stage, runs ‘yarn test’ to run the test suit.
In the ‘Build Docker Image’ stage, builds a Docker image for the application. The image is named ‘my-node-app’ and is tagged with the build number.
In the ‘Push Docker Image’ stage, pushes the Docker image to a registry. 
In the ‘Deploy to Kubernetes’ stage, uses the ‘kubectl’ command to update the deployment with the new image. The ‘Kubectl’ command is run with the ‘kubeconfig’

Question: now adjust the jenkinsfile to have 1 stage for building and pushing the docker image and logging in to the dockerHub private repository. In the final stage, apply deployment and service files to the cluster, but keep the KUBE_CONFIG parameter 

Here is an example Jenkinsfile that adjust the CI/CD pipeline to have one stage for building and pushing the Docker image and logging in to the Docker Hub private repository, and another stage for applying the deployment and the service files to the Kubernetes cluster:

pipeline {
agent any

stages {
stage(‘Build and Push Docker Image’) {
steps {
   sh ‘yarn install’
   sh ‘yarn build’
   sh ‘docker build -t my-node-app:$BUILD_NUMBER’
    withCredentials([string(credentialsId: ‘docker-hub-credentials’, variable: ‘DOKER_HUB_PASSWORD’ )]) {
    sh ‘echo$DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD | docker login -u $DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME - - - password-stdin’ 
   sh ‘docker push my-node-app:$BUILD_NUMBER’
      }
    }
  }
   stage(‘Deploy to Kubernetes’) {
     steps {
        withCredentials([string(credentialsId: ‘K8s-clusters-credentials’ 
       variable: ‘KUBE_CONFIG’)]) {
       sh ‘kubectl - - kubeconfig-$KUBE_CONFIG applay -f deployment yaml
       sh ‘kubectl - - kubeconfig-$HUBE_CONFIG applay -f service yaml’ 
          }
         }
        }
       }
      }
This jenkinsfile does the following:
Define a pipeline with two stages: ‘Build and Push Docker’

Question: Keep the build and test stage as the were initially, but create a separate stage for building a docker image and pushing to docker repository, but before pushing image, make sure to log in to the docker repository first 

Here is an example jenkinsfile that keeps the build and test stages as the were initially, and adds a separate stage for building a Docker image and pushing it to a Docker repository: 

pipeline {
 agent any
 stages {
  stage(‘Build’) {
    steps {
     sh ‘yarn install’
      sh ‘yarn build’
     }
   }
 stage(‘Test’) {
    steps {
       sh ‘yarn test’ 
    }
   }
stage (‘Build and push Docker image’) {
   steps {
      sh ‘docker build -t my-node-app:$BUILD_NUMBER . ’
       withCredentials([string(credentialsId: ‘docker-hub-credentials’ , variable: ‘DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD’)]) {
            sh ‘echo $DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD’ | docker login -u DOCKER_HUB_URSERNAME - - password-stdin’ 
             sh ‘docker push my-node-app:$BUILD_NUMBER’
           }
         }
        }
       }
    }
This Jenkinsfile does the following:
Defines a pipeline with three stages:’Build’, ‘Test’ and ‘Build and Push Docker Image’.
In the ‘Build’ stage, run the ‘yarn install’ and ‘yarn build’ to build the Node.js application.
In the ‘Test’ stage, run the ‘yarn test’ to run the test suit.
In the ‘Build and Push the Docker Image’ stage, builds a Docker image for the application and Push it to a Docker registry. Before pushing the image, it logs in to the Docker registry using the ‘docker login’ command. This image is name ‘my-node-app’ and is tagged with the build number.

Question: add deploy to kubernetes stage as in the previous example. Also read the DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME as a credential, just like the DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD, but call them DOCKER_USER and DOCKER_PWD respectively and also use the credentials function instead of withCredentials to read both of these values 

Here is an example Jenkinsfile that adds a stage for deploying to a Kubernetes cluster, and reads the Docker Hub username and password as credentials using the ‘credentials’ function:

pipeline {
 agent any 
 stages {
  stage (‘build’) {
    steps {
      sh ‘yarn install’
      sh ‘yarn build’
      }
    }
   stage(‘Test’) {
     steps {
       sh ‘yarn test’ 
    }
   }
         stage(‘Build and Push Docker Image’) {
           steps {
             sh ‘docker build -t my-node-app:$BUILD_NUMBER’
              withCredentials([string(credentialsId: ‘docker_hub_credentials’, variable: ‘DOCKER_USER’), string(credentialsId: ‘docker_hub_credentials’, variables: ‘DOCKER_PWD’)]) {
                  sh ‘echo $DOCKER_PWD  | docker login -u $DOCKER_USER - - password-stdin”  
                     sh ‘docker push my-node-app:BUILD_NUMBER’
            }
         }
     }
            stage(‘Deploy to Kubernetes’) {
              steps {
                 withCredentials([string(credentialsId: ‘k8s-cluster-credentials’, variable: ‘KUBE_CONFIG’)]) {
                     sh ‘kubectl - - kubeconfig-$KUBE_CONFIG apply -f deployment.yaml’
                     sh ‘kubectl - - kubeconfig-$KUBE_CONFIG apply -f service.yaml’
                     }
                   }
                 }
               }
             }
This Jenkinsfile does the following:

Defines a pipeline with four stages:’Build’, ‘Test’, ‘Build and Push Docker Image’ and ‘Deploy to Kubernetes’.
In the ‘Build’ stage, runs ‘yaml install’ and ‘yaml build’ to build the Node.js application.
In the ‘Test’ stage, runs ‘yaml test’ to run the test suite.
in the ‘Build and Push Docker image’ stage, builds a Docker image for the application and pushes it to a Docker registry. Before pushing the image, it log in to the Docker registry using the ‘docker login’ command. The image is named ‘my-node-app’ and is tagged with the build number. The Docker hub username and password are read as credentials using the ‘credentials’ function.
In the ‘Deploy to Kubernetes’ stage, uses the ‘kubectl’ command to apply the deployment and service files to the Kubernetes cluster. The ‘kubectl’ command is run with the ‘kubeconfig’ stored in the ‘KUBE_CONFIG’ variable.

Notify about build status via Slack 

Question: add a stage to notify team through slack channel about the build status

To add a stage to the Jenkinsfile that notify the team through a Slack channel about the build status, you can use the Slack Notification Plugin. 
Here is an example of how to add a stage to the Jenkinsfile that sends a notification to a Slack channel:

stage(‘Notify Slack’) {
  steps {
     slackSend color: ‘# 00FF00’, message: “Build #${BUILD_NUMBER}‘ succeeded
     }
}

This stage will send a notification to the Slack channel with the message “BUILD #{$BUILD_NUMBER}”succeeded and a green color.
To set up the Slack Notification Plugin, you will need to configure the plugin with your Slack workspace and channel details. For more information on how to set up the plugin, see the plugin´s documentation at https://plugins.jenkins.io/slack 
You can add the ‘Notify Slack’ stage to the Jenkinsfile by placing it after the ‘Deploy to Kubernetes’ stage, like this: 

pipeline {
  agent any
  stage(‘Build’) {
    steps {
     sh ‘yarn install’
     sh ‘yarn build’ 
   }
  }
   stage(‘Test’) {
    steps {
      sh ‘yarn test’ 
   }
  }
    stage (‘Build and Push Docker Image’) {
     steps {
       sh ‘docker build -t my-node-app: $BUILD_NUMBER. ‘ 

Question: slack notification should be sent either for failure or success and should always execute after the build is finished as the last step 

To send a notification to Slack when the build succeeds or fails and to always execute it as the last step, you can use the ‘post’ block in the Jenkinsfile. 
The ‘post’ block is executed after all stages have completed, regardless of whether the build succeeded or failed. You can use it to send notifications to Slack or perform other actions that should always be executed after the build is finished. 
Here is an example of how to use the ‘post’ block to send notifications to Slack when the build succeeds or fails:

post {
 always {
   if (currentBuild.currentResult ==’SUCCESS’) {
     slackSend color: ‘#00FF00’, message: “Build #${BUILD_NUMBER} succeeded!” 
 }    else { /
        slackSend color: ‘#00FF00’, message: “Build #${Build_Number} failed!”  
    }
   }
  }

This ‘post’ block will send a notification to the Slack channel with the message “Build #${BUILD_NUMBER} succeeded !” and a green color if the build succeeded, or with the message “Build #${BUILD_NUMBER} failed!” and a red color if the build failed.
To set up the Slack Notification Plugin, you will need to configure the plugin with your Slack workspace and channel details. For more information on how to set up the plugin, see the plugin´s documentation at https://plugins.jenkins.io/slack.

Here is the updated jenkinsfile with the ‘post’ block add:

pipeline {
 agent any 
  stages {
    stage(‘Build’) {
      steps {
      sh ‘yarn install’
      sh ‘yarn build’
     }
   }
stage(‘Test’) {
 steps {
  sh ‘yarn test’ 
    }
   }
stage (‘Build and Push Docker Image’) {
 steps {
 sh ‘docker build -t my-node-app:$BUILD_NUMBER.’
  withCredentials([string(credentials 

Question: continue with your response

Certainly! Here is the rest of the Jenkinsfile with the ‘post’ block added:

pipeline {
  agent any 
    stages 
      stage (‘Build’) {
        steps {
          sh ‘yarn instal’
          sh ‘yarn build’
        }
       }
          stage (‘Test’) {
         steps { 
        sh ‘yarn test’ 
      }
    }
      stage (‘Build and Push Docker Image’) {
    steps {
  sh ‘docker build -t my-node-app:$BUILD_NUMBER.’ 
 withCredentials([string(credentialsId: ‘docker_hub_credentials’, variable:’DOCKER_USE’ ), string(credentialsId: ‘docker_hub_credentials’, variable: DOCKER_PWD’)]) {
 sh “echo $DOCKER_PWD | docker login -u $DOCKER_USE - -password-stdin” 
   sh ‘docker push my-node-app:$BUILD_NUMBER’
    }
   }
  }
stage (‘Deploy to Kubernetes’) {
  staps {
    withCredentials([string(credentials Id: ‘k8s-cluster-credentials’, variable: ‘KUBE_CONFIG’)]) {
        env.BUID_NUMBER - ‘1.0’
         sh ‘kubectl - - kubeconfig-$KUBE_CONFIG apply -f deployment.yaml’
         sh ‘kubectl - - kubeconfig-$KUBE_CONFIG apply -f service.yaml’
      }
     }
    }
   }

post {
 always {
  if(currentBuild.currentResult == ‘SUCCESS’) {
   slackSend color: ‘#00FF00’, message: “Build #${BUILD_NUMBER} successed”
     } else {
        slackSend color: ‘#00FF00’, message: “Build #${BUILD_NUMBER} failed!” 
      }
    }
  }
}


DevOps Task 4: 
Convert Jenkinsfile to GitLab CI config file 

Question: give me a GitLab equivalent of this Jenkinsfile: 

give me a GitLab equivalent of this Jenkingsfile: pipeline {
 agent any
  stages {
   stage(‘Build’) {
     steps {
       sh ‘yarn install’
       sh ‘yarn build’
    }
stage(‘Build and Push Docker Image’) {
 steps {
   sh ‘docker build -t my-node-app:$BUILD_NUMBER.
     withCredentials([string(credentialsId: ’docker-hub-credentials’, variable:’DOCKER_USER’), string(credentialsId: ‘docker-hub-credentials’,variable:’DOCKER_PWD’)]) { 
         sh “echo $DOCKER_PWD | docker login -u $DOCKER_USER - - password-stdin” 
         sh ‘docker push my-node-app:$BUILD_NUMBER’
      }
   }
}

stage(‘Deploy to Kubernetes’) {
 steps {
   withCredentials([string(credentialsId: ‘k8s-cluster-credentials’, variable: ‘KUBE_CONFIG’)]) {
     env.BUILD_NUMBER = ‘1.0’ 
       sh ‘kubectl - - kubeconfig=$KUBE_CONFIG apply -f deployment.yaml’
       sh ‘kubectl - - kubeconfig=$KUBE_CONFIG apply -f service.yaml’
       }
      }
     }
    }
   }

To convert the Jenkinsfile to a GitLab CI configuration file (‘.gitlab-ci.yml’), you will need to replace the ‘pipeline’ block with a ‘stages’ block and the ‘stage’ blocks with ‘job’ blocks.
You can also remove the ‘agent’ block, as the ‘image’ key can be used to specify the Docker image to use for the job. 
Here is an example of how the Jenkinsfile you provided can be converted to a GitLab CI configuration file:

stages:
build
test 
build and push 
deploy
build and push:
 image: docker: stable
  variables: 
    DOCKER_USER: $DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME
    DOCKER_PWD: $DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD
before_script:
echo “DOCKER_PWD” | docker login -u “DOCKER_USER” - - password-stdin
script:
‘yarn install’
‘yarn build’
docker build -t my-node-app:$CI_PIPELINE_IID .
docker push my-node-app:$CI_PIPELINE_IID

deploy:
 image: docker:stable 
  variables:
    KUBE_CONFIG: $KUBE_CONFIG_CONTENT
      before_script 
mkdir -p ~/.kube 
echo “KUBE_CONFIG” > ~/.kube/config
script:
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml 
kubectl apply -f service.yaml

This ‘gitlab-ci.yml’ file defines four steps: ‘build’, ‘test’, ‘build_and_push’, and ‘deploy’. The ‘build_and_push’ and ‘deploy’ stages are based on the ‘Build and Push Docker Image’ and ‘Deploy to Kubernetes’ stages from the Jenkinsfile, respectively. The ‘build_and_push’ stage uses the ‘docker’ image, sets the ‘DOCKER_USER’ and ‘DOCKER_PWD’ variables from the ‘DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME’ and ‘DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD’ secrets logs in to the Docker Hub repository, and runs the ‘yarn install’, ‘yarn build’, ‘docker build’ and the ‘docker push’ commands. The ‘deploy’ stage uses the ‘docker’ image, sets the ‘KUBE_CONFIG’ variable from the ‘KUBE_CONFIG_CONTENT’ secret, creates a ‘~/.kube’ directory and writes the ‘KUBE_CONFIG’ to a ‘config’ file in that directory, and runs the ‘kubectl apply’ commands.
